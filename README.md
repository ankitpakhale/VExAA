# **VExAA â€“ Video Extraction & Audio Assembly**

## **Project Overview**:

**VExAA** is a cloud-based solution designed for the extraction of audio from video files, enabling seamless video-to-audio conversion. This tool offers scalability, flexibility, and efficient deployment, allowing users to easily convert video files to audio formats for various applications such as podcasting, content creation, and archival purposes.

## **Tech Stack**:

- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing conversion logic and backend development.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for packaging applications and dependencies into a standardized unit for development, testing, and deployment.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Minikube**: Local Kubernetes environment for running and testing Kubernetes clusters on your local machine.
- **K9S**: Terminal-based UI for managing Kubernetes clusters, providing an efficient way to interact with and monitor Kubernetes resources.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system used to store and manage application data.

## **Core Features**:

1. **Video Upload**: Users can upload video files via API or web interface.
2. **Audio Extraction**: The system uses FFmpeg to extract audio from the video files in different formats.
3. **File Management**: Stores converted audio files in a scalable storage solution.
4. **Background Processing**: Task queuing for processing large video files without overloading the system, using Celery for asynchronous task handling.
5. **Scalability**: Docker and Kubernetes enable the application to scale according to demand, ensuring smooth operations even with high traffic.
6. **Performance Optimizations**: Redis caching for faster access to frequently used resources and improved conversion speeds.

## **Deployment**:

- **Docker**: The application is containerized for easy deployment across environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Enables seamless scaling and management of microservices, ensuring the application can handle increased user requests.
- **Cloud Storage**: Converted audio files can be stored in scalable cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

## **Objective**:

The primary goal of **VExAA** is to provide a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly platform for converting video files to audio files, making it easier for content creators, businesses, and individuals to extract audio for their projects.
